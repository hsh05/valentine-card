                <h2>To My Special Girl</h2>
                <p>
                    Happy valentine's day! Another valentine where there's a thousand miles between us, but we keep trying to make it work for one day we celebrate together.
                    I love spending every moment with you even when we're not together physically. Since I'm not made of money and just a broke uni student this is the best and most intimate thing I can do!
                    I love you so much and I hope you like this small little idea.
                    <br><br>
                    From the moment you arrived in my life I've fallen in love for you more and more, I love knowing more about you each day. You changed my life for the better and I'm grateful for it.
                    I love making you happy and hearing you laugh because your laugh is like medicine for me, if that even makes sense in the first place. Nothing in this world would compare to you and nothing could capture how much you mean to me.
                    Whatever happens in life, I hope I go through it with you holding your hand, because I want to face everything with you.
                </p>
